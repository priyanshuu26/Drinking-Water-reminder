 In this, the remind_to_drink_water function takes two arguments: interval and duration. The interval represents the time in minutes between each reminder, and the duration represents the total duration of reminders in minutes.

The function calculates the number of reminders based on the given interval and duration. Then, it enters a loop and uses time.sleep() to pause the program for the specified interval in seconds. After each pause, it prints a reminder to drink water.
